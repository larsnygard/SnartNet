## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to implementing the PeerSocial protocol over 18 months. The phased approach ensures that each component is thoroughly tested before moving to the next phase, while allowing for parallel development in later stages.

Success will depend on maintaining high code quality, conducting thorough security reviews, and building a vibrant developer and user community around the protocol. Regular milestone reviews and adaptation of the roadmap based on technical discoveries and user feedback will be essential.

The ultimate goal is to create a truly decentralized social media protocol that empowers users with control over their data, identity, and social connections while maintaining the performance and usability expected from modern applications.
