# SnartNet PWA - Development Setup Complete! 🎉

The SnartNet Progressive Web App is now properly configured and ready for development.

## ✅ What's Working

### Core Infrastructure
- **React 18** with TypeScript and modern JSX transform
- **Vite** development server and build system
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with dark mode support
- **Progressive Web App** capabilities with service worker
- **Zustand** state management setup
- **React Router** for navigation

### Project Structure
```

    └── crypto/         # Cryptography utilities
        └── keys.ts     # Key management (basic Web Crypto API)
```

### Development Features
- **Hot Module Replacement** for fast development
- **TypeScript** strict mode with proper configuration
- **ESLint** with React and TypeScript rules
- **Build optimization** with code splitting and PWA generation
- **Mock core interface** ready for Rust WASM integration

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## 🏗️ Current State

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Complete React + Vite + TypeScript setup
- [x] PWA configuration with service worker
- [x] Basic routing and layout structure  
- [x] Mock timeline with sample data
- [x] Core interface designed for WASM integration
- [x] State management architecture
- [x] Build pipeline and development workflow

### 🔄 Ready for Next Steps
- [ ] **Rust Core Library** - Create the WASM module
- [ ] **Profile Management UI** - Complete profile creation/editing
- [ ] **Post Composer** - Rich text editor for creating posts
- [ ] **Real Cryptography** - Replace Web Crypto API with Rust implementation
- [ ] **P2P Networking** - WebTorrent integration for content distribution
- [ ] **Messaging System** - Encrypted direct and group messaging

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### State Management
The app uses **Zustand** for lightweight state management with TypeScript support:

- `profileStore` - User profiles and identity management
- Future stores: `postStore`, `messageStore`, `networkStore`

### Core Interface  
The `lib/core.ts` module provides a clean interface for the Rust WASM core:

```typescript
interface SnartNetCore {
  // Profile management
  createProfile(username: string): Promise<string>
  loadProfile(magnetUri: string): Promise<any>
  
  // Cryptography
  generateKeys(): Promise<{ publicKey: string; fingerprint: string }>
  signData(data: string): Promise<string>
  
  // Content
  createPost(content: string, tags?: string[]): Promise<string>
  getTimeline(): Promise<any[]>
  
  // Events
  subscribeToEvents(callback: EventCallback): () => void
}
```

### WASM Integration Plan
The current mock implementation will be replaced with:
1. **Rust core library** compiled to WASM with `wasm-bindgen`
2. **TypeScript bindings** auto-generated from Rust interfaces  
3. **Event-driven architecture** for real-time updates
4. **Secure key management** (private keys never leave Rust)

## 📋 Next Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Rust Core Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. Create Rust workspace with WASM target
2. Implement basic key generation (Ed25519)
3. Profile serialization and signing
4. WASM bindings and JS integration
5. Replace mock core with real implementation

### Phase 2: Enhanced UI (Week 2-3)  
1. Profile creation and management interface
2. Post composer with rich text support
3. Timeline improvements and real-time updates
4. Basic settings and configuration UI

### Phase 3: P2P Features (Week 3-4)
1. WebTorrent integration for content distribution
2. DHT-based peer discovery (WebRTC)
3. Magnet URI handling and sharing
4. Initial messaging system

## 🔧 Development Notes

### Hot Reload
The development server supports hot reload for both React components and CSS. TypeScript errors are shown in the browser overlay.

### Build Optimization
The production build is optimized with:
- Code splitting by route
- CSS optimization and purging
- PWA service worker generation
- Source maps for debugging

### PWA Features
- Offline-capable with service worker caching
- Installable on desktop and mobile
- App-like experience with proper manifest

**Status:** ✅ Development environment ready  
**Next:** Start building the Rust core library

The PWA foundation is solid and ready for the next phase of development!
