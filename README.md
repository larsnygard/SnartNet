# SnartNet

This is a decentralized social + messaging protocol and application suite in the conceptual / early implementation stage.

**Verified, signed, and decentralized social media and messaging.**

SnartNet is a revolutionary decentralized social media protocol that gives users complete control over their identity, data, and social connections. Built on BitTorrent-like swarm technology and modern cryptography, it enables truly peer-to-peer social networking without reliance on centralized servers or corporate platforms.

> Current Focus (2025‚Äì2026): Ship a cross‚Äëplatform GUI experience (Web PWA + Mobile) early. The CLI is a developer tool; end‚Äëuser adoption hinges on a polished graphical client backed by a reusable Rust/WASM core.

## ÔøΩ DHT Push Updates (Experimental)

SnartNet includes an experimental real-time push notification system for head updates using libp2p gossipsub. This feature enables instant propagation of new posts without polling.

### How It Works

- When you create or edit a post, your client regenerates the post index head and publishes a signed head update event
- Other clients subscribed to the gossipsub topic (`snartnet.head.v1`) receive the update immediately
- The update contains the new head magnet URI, allowing peers to sync your latest posts instantly
- All updates are Ed25519 signed and verified to prevent spam and ensure authenticity

### Enabling libp2p Push

By default, SnartNet uses an in-memory transport for head updates (local testing only). To enable real network push:

**Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
```bash
# In PWA/.env.development or PWA/.env.local
VITE_ENABLE_LIBP2P=true
```

**Option 2: Runtime Flag**
```javascript
// In browser console before initialization
window.SNARTNET_ENABLE_LIBP2P = true
```

Then restart your development server (`npm run dev` in the PWA directory).

### Debugging Push Network

When libp2p is enabled, several debugging objects are exposed on `window`:

- `window.snartnetLibp2p` - The libp2p node instance
- `window.lastPublishedHeadUpdate` - Most recent head update you published
- `window.__sn_head_sig_cache` - Cache of received signature hashes (dedupe)
- `window.__sn_head_published_count` - Number of head updates you've published

The PWA includes a live status indicator in the bottom-right corner showing:
- Transport type (in-memory vs libp2p)
- Connected peer count
- Head updates received/published

### Bootstrap Peers (Optional)

To connect to other libp2p nodes, add bootstrap peer multiaddresses to localStorage:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('snartnet:bootstrapPeers', JSON.stringify([
  '/ip4/192.168.1.100/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooW...',
  '/ip6/::1/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooW...'
]))
```

### Security & Rate Limiting

The push system includes built-in protections:
- **Signature verification**: All head updates must be properly signed
- **Deduplication**: Identical signatures are ignored
- **Rate limiting**: Max 30 updates per profile per minute
- **Timestamp validation**: Updates outside ¬±5 minute window are rejected

## ÔøΩüõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Core Protocol
- **Language:** Rust (performance, safety, cross-platform)
- **Cryptography:** libsodium, Ed25519, Curve25519
- **Networking:** libtorrent-rasterbar, DHT, WebRTC, **libp2p gossipsub** (push updates)
- **Serialization:** JSON, Protocol Buffers

### Client Applications
- **Web (Primary First Target):** React + WASM core + Service Worker (PWA)
- **Mobile:** React Native (bridging to Rust core via uniffi or napi-rs) *(evaluation in progress)*
- **CLI (Developer Tool):** Rust (maintenance & diagnostics)
- **Desktop (Future):** Tauri (shared web UI code)

### Shared Core Strategy
- Single Rust core library compiled to native + WASM.
- Deterministic serialization + capability flags for forward compatibility.
- Event-driven state sync (observer pattern over async channels).
- Pluggable storage (RocksDB native / IndexedDB via wasm-bindgen).

## üîí Security

Security is paramount in SnartNet. We employ multiple layers of protection:

### Cryptographic Security
- **Ed25519** for digital signatures (state-of-the-art elliptic curve)
- **Curve25519** for key exchange (perfect forward secrecy)
- **AES-256** and **ChaCha20** for symmetric encryption
- **Argon2** for key derivation and password hashing

### Network Security
- All content is cryptographically signed and verifiable
- Messages use hybrid encryption with forward secrecy
- Metadata leakage minimized through encrypted headers
- Protection against Sybil, DDoS, and MITM attacks

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:
1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Email security@snartnet.org with details *(placeholder address until domain provisioning completed; use GPG if sensitive)*
3. Include steps to reproduce if possible
4. Allow 90 days for coordinated disclosure

We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide updates on our investigation.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è FAQ

### **Q: How is this different from Mastodon/ActivityPub?**
A: While Mastodon federates servers, SnartNet is truly peer-to-peer with no servers required. Users directly connect and share content via torrent swarms, providing stronger censorship resistance and user control.

### **Q: What about blockchain/cryptocurrency integration?**
A: SnartNet focuses on communication, not monetization. While future versions may support optional cryptocurrency features, the core protocol remains blockchain-free for simplicity and efficiency.

### **Q: How do you handle illegal content or spam?**
A: Each user curates their own network through the Ring of Trust system. Communities can establish shared moderation standards, but there's no central authority to impose universal censorship.

### **Q: What's the mobile battery impact?**
A: Extensive optimizations including wake-on-swarm, notification torrents, and selective sync ensure battery usage comparable to traditional messaging apps.

### **Q: Is this ready for production use?**
A: No, SnartNet is currently experimental. We're in active development with alpha releases planned for early 2026.
